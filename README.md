# Precision Height Detection Algorithm

This project involves developing a height detection algorithm for a CNC machine designed to work with precise copper plates. The algorithm calculates the height at a desired position based on a given matrix of height values. By utilizing linear interpolation, it produces accurate results at a micrometric level. This high level of precision is essential for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the CNC machining process, particularly when dealing with delicate and intricate designs on copper plates.
